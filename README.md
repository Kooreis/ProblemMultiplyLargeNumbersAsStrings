# Question: How do you write a program to multiply two large numbers represented as strings? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `multiply` takes two string arguments, `num1` and `num2`, which represent large numbers. It first checks if either string is empty, returning "0" if so. It then creates an array, `result`, filled with zeros, with a length equal to the sum of the lengths of `num1` and `num2`. The function then iterates over each digit in `num1` and `num2` in reverse order, converting each character to its numeric value using the `charCodeAt` method. It multiplies these values together, adds any carry from the previous iteration, and adds the value at the corresponding index in `result`. The sum is then divided by 10 to calculate the carry for the next iteration, and the remainder is stored in `result`. This process is repeated for each digit in `num1` and `num2`. If there is a carry after the last iteration, it is added to `result`. The function then trims any leading zeros from `result` and converts it back into a string, which is returned as the product of `num1` and `num2`. This approach allows for multiplication of numbers that are too large to be represented as integers in JavaScript.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version. Both versions solve the problem by treating each digit as a separate number, multiplying them individually, and adding the results to the appropriate positions in the result array. The result array is then converted back into a string and returned.

However, there are a few differences between the two versions:

1. Type Annotations: In the TypeScript version, the function parameters `num1` and `num2` are explicitly typed as strings, and the return type of the function is also explicitly typed as a string. This is a feature of TypeScript that is not available in JavaScript.

2. Conversion to Number: In the JavaScript version, the characters are converted to numbers using the `charCodeAt()` method and subtracting the char code of '0'. In the TypeScript version, the `Number()` function is used to convert the characters to numbers.

3. Array Manipulation: In the JavaScript version, the result array is manipulated using a combination of array indexing and the `+=` operator. In the TypeScript version, the `shift()` method is used to remove leading zeros from the result array, and the `join('')` method is used to convert the result array back into a string.

4. Error Handling: The TypeScript version includes a check to return "0" if the result array is empty after removing leading zeros. This is not present in the JavaScript version.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution follows the same logic as the JavaScript version. Both versions multiply each digit of the first number by each digit of the second number, add the result to the corresponding position in the result array, and handle any carry-over. The result array is then converted back into a string and returned.

However, there are some differences due to the language features and methods used in each version:

1. Array Initialization: In JavaScript, an array is initialized with a specified length and filled with zeros using the `Array(len1 + len2).fill(0)` syntax. In C++, a `std::vector` is used instead, which is initialized with a specified size and filled with zeros using the `std::vector<int> result(n1 + n2, 0)` syntax.

2. Character to Integer Conversion: In JavaScript, the `charCodeAt()` method is used to convert a character to its ASCII value, and then the ASCII value of '0' is subtracted to get the integer value of the digit. In C++, the ASCII value of '0' is directly subtracted from the character to get the integer value.

3. String Concatenation: In JavaScript, the `+=` operator is used to concatenate the string representation of each digit to the result string. In C++, the `std::to_string()` function is used to convert each digit to a string, and then the `+=` operator is used for concatenation.

4. Input/Output: The C++ version includes a `main()` function that prompts the user to enter the two numbers, handles negative numbers, and then prints the product. The JavaScript version does not include any user interaction and simply calls the `multiply()` function with two hard-coded numbers.

5. Error Handling: The C++ version includes some error handling for negative numbers, which is not present in the JavaScript version. If either of the input strings starts with a '-', it is removed and a '-' is added to the output if necessary.
